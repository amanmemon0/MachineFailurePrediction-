**⚙️ Machine Failure Prediction using Random Forest**

This project is part of my Data Analytics Capstone, where I developed a predictive model using machine sensor data to anticipate machine failures before they happen. By leveraging a Random Forest Classifier, the goal is to enable proactive maintenance and reduce costly downtimes in industrial systems.

**📊 Dataset Overview**

The dataset includes real-world sensor readings from industrial machines. Each row represents a snapshot of machine conditions and a label indicating whether a failure occurred.

**Features include**:

Footfall: Number of people/objects near the machine

Temp Mode: Machine temperature setting

AQ: Air Quality Index

USS: Ultrasonic sensor (proximity) data

CS: Electrical current usage

VOC: Volatile organic compounds detected

RP: Machine RPM (revolutions per minute)

IP: Input pressure

Temperature: Operating temperature

Fail: Binary target — 1 for failure, 0 for normal operation


**✅ What This Project Covers**

📌 Exploratory Data Analysis

🧼 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

🧠 Model Training using Random Forest Classifier

🧪 Model Evaluation 

🔮 Future Failure Prediction on new unseen data


**🛠️ Tools & Technologies**

Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn

Model: RandomForestClassifier (ensemble method)

**📈 Key Results**

The model achieved high accuracy and robust performance across all classification metrics. The Random Forest's feature importance scores also revealed which sensors contribute most to predicting failure.
